Your data is used solely for authentication, account management, and improving your experience within the app.

We do not collect additional personal information, such as location data, contacts, or usage behavior. Your information will never be sold, rented, or exchanged with other companies for marketing purposes.

We take reasonable measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification. However, no method of storage or transmission over the internet is completely secure, and by using this app, you acknowledge these inherent risks.

Users have the right to review, update, or delete their personal information stored within the app at any time. We encourage you to keep your data accurate and up-to-date to ensure the best possible experience.

This privacy policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or applicable laws. We recommend reviewing it periodically to stay informed about how your information is protected.
